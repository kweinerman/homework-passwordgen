# Random Password Generator

## Uses

Please use this site to generate a rnadom password and ensure security within your log in data. 

You can select passowrd length (minimum of 8 characters and a max of 128) from the window prompt

You will be prompted with a few adidtional conditions - Uppercase, Lowercase, Number, Special characters. 

If you do not select any characters from the window prompts we will not be able to generate your password

From there you can copy your password and use for your own secrity!

Within the code I created a random function that uses Math.floor and Math.random to pull out a random character from their selected bucket (Upper, Lower, Special, Numbers)

This is conjuction with the selections from the window prompt will power our random password generator.
